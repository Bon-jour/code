nohup: ignoring input
Warning message:
package 'optparse' was built under R version 4.2.3 
Warning: future: Ignoring requested number of processes, because it is greater than the number of cores/child processes available (= 256) to this R process: -p 5000
The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
     (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)
